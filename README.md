# Bankist--app
🏦 Bankist App
Bankist is a fully functional front-end banking application built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It mimics real-world banking operations such as money transfers, loan applications, and multi-currency support, providing an excellent learning experience in DOM manipulation, UI logic, and interactive JavaScript programming — without any libraries or frameworks.

🌟 Key Features
🔐 Secure Login System
Users can log in using a username and PIN. Once authenticated, they see their personal dashboard with transaction history and balance.

💸 Money Transfers (Withdrawals & Deposits)
Users can withdraw and deposit money.

The account balance updates in real time.

Every transaction is stored and displayed in the transaction history, along with the date and time of the operation.

🏦 Loan Application
Users can apply for bank loans.

Basic logic ensures that a user is eligible for a loan based on their current balance or past deposits.

If approved, the loan is added to the account and shown as a transaction.

🌍 Multi-Currency & Localization
The app supports currency conversion (e.g., EUR, USD).

Dates and currency formats adjust according to the user's locale, providing a more realistic experience.

📅 Transaction History
All user actions (deposits, withdrawals, loans) are stored as movements.

Each transaction is timestamped and styled with conditional formatting (e.g., positive for deposits, negative for withdrawals).

🌗 Dark / Light Theme (Optional)
The app can include a theme switcher for better accessibility and aesthetics.
